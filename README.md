# Human_Activities_Recognition_Poject

The aim of this project is to investigate the performance of different deep-learning architectures for recognizing human activities.
We compare models used in the literature for detecting human activities from sensor data or video streams. 
We use both off-the-shelf pre-trained models and models trained from scratch. 
we use optical flow and RGB charades dataset to train our models.

We have used Charades competition starter code to run our models, the code can be found here: https://github.com/gsig/charades-algorithms
