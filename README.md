# Human_Activities_Recognition_Poject

The aim of this project is to investigate the performance of different deep-learning architectures for recognizing human activities.
We compare models used in the literature for detecting human activities from sensor data or video streams. 
We use both off-the-shelf pre-trained models and models trained from scratch. 
we use optical flow and RGB charades dataset to train our models.
